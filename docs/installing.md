# Installing the Application

Using homebrew on a mac will install the latest stable release:

```
brew cask install reactotron
```

On the [Releases](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/releases) page, you can find the latest (and beta) versions for:

* macOS
* Linux (32-bit & 64-bit)
* Windows (32-bit & 64-bit)

### Auto Updates

Once you have the application installed it should download and alert you that a new version is available and that new version should be installed on next launch.
